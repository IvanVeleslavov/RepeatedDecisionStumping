# Repeated Decision Stumping (ReDX)

"Repeated Decision Stumping Distils Simple Rules from Complex Data" by Ivan Croydon-Veleslavov and Professor Michael Stumpf.

Repository contains a Jupyter notebook regenerating the results from the paper, where we learn decision stumps from single-cell gene expression data of murine neural development and _Xenopus tropicalis_ embryogenesis with ReDX. Also contains Julia scripts for generating supplementary results.
